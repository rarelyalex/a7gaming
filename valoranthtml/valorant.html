      <h2 id="ali">game explanation</h2>
      <p>Valorant is a first-person shooter with an objective-based focus that
        revolves around planting and diffusing bombs.<br>
        <br>
        You'll be split between attackers and defenders, protecting or
        assaulting bomb spots, and while your shooting skill is key to success,
        you'll also be able to use different character abilities. <br>
        <br>
        With some characters focused on disorientating enemies, others focused
        on support, and some straight out damage-dealers, there's a lot to
        learn.</p>

      <p>the reason I love this game is because i am really into fist person
        shooting games, and Valorant is a game where i can show my shooting
        skills. <br>

        other with their abilities, which makes the key to winning the game is
        through team play and good comunication.</p>
