  <h2>What is aaaRainbowsix Siege?</h2>
  <p class="p1">At its heart, Rainbow Six Siege is a high-precision, tactical shooter that prioritises careful planning teamwork and finely tuned tactical play. <br>
Since its release in 2015, the game has radically expanded, adding extra maps, new operators, weapons, and themed seasonal events.<br>
The game has even undergone major technical overhauls, allowing for new modes of play and more diverse character designs. </p>

  <h3>Why I love the game!</h3>
  <p id="p2">The reason I love this game is because it focuses a lot on game sense and it allows you to outsmart other players using map knowlegde and player abilities. <br>
  Another reason is because it is a team based game, meaning that all other players have to communicate and create strategies in order to win rounds and matches. <br>
  It gives me a good feeling of achievement when you are able to make plays that no one expects and flank people from behind to get as much kills as possible, <br>
however, the game requires you to have an idea of the map in order to be able to successfully cover them and to be aware of where the players are at the same time. </p>
