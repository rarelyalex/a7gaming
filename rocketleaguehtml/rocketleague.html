   <h2>What is Rocket league?</h2>
    <p class="p1">Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars," <br>
      Rocket League involves two teams that use rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match.<br>
    <br>
    Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other goal to score points.<br>
     Rocket League resembles a soccer game with elements of a demolition derby.
  Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in midair. <br>
  The players can also pick up speed boosts by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, <br>
  enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it. (Destroyed cars respawn moments later.)<br>
  Matches are typically five minutes long with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point.</p>

      <h3>Why I love the game!</h3>
      <p class="p2" >the reason i love this game is because its a fast-paced game where you are able to show your skills and mechanics in the field as you play with your team mates or alone.<br>
      it also is really fun to play with your friends, and you can be creative with your mechanics and show how good of a player you are.<br>
    the game requires a lot of game time and practice to be able to use mechanics properly as it gets more competitive as you progress in the game.  </p>
